## How to use

```java
VideoCapture video = new VideoCapture(0); // change the integer to 1 if the webcam is plugged in via usb

Number of Rows & Number of Columns: // Enter even numbers 

WaitTime: // Enter the amount of miliseconds for the application to wait between each change

Camera: // To close the application or genearte a new maze deactive the camera
```

## Maze Generation

After researching many different algoirthms for generating a random maze I chose to implement Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm. This algorithm was developed by the mathematician and computer scientist Joseph Kruskal in 1956. The algorithm works by starting off with a set of edges and merging the edges, as long it doesn't create a loop. As shown the in picture below. 

To see further explainations of researching and implementing the algorithm look at Chapter (2.5.2) and (5.4) from my [dissertation](#dissertation).
