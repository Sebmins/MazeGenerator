## What can it do

Generate a random maze and show the user step by step how it is generated
Solve the maze with 3 differing algorithms, capturing data on time taken, amount of wrong turns, etc.
Video integration to allow the maze to be overlayed ontop of the video.
Solve the maze with an algorithm that can be translated into directions for a human/robot. Input avaliable for robot to solve the maze.


## How to use

```java
VideoCapture video = new VideoCapture(0); // change the integer to 1 if the webcam is plugged in via usb

Number of Rows & Number of Columns: // Enter even numbers 

WaitTime: // Enter the amount of miliseconds for the application to wait between each change

Camera: // To close the application or genearte a new maze deactive the camera
```

## Maze Generation

After researching many different algoirthms for generating a random maze I chose to implement Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm. This algorithm was developed by the mathematician and computer scientist Joseph Kruskal in 1956. The algorithm works by starting off with a set of edges and merging the edges, as long it doesn't create a loop. As shown the in picture below. 

To see further explainations of researching and implementing the algorithm look at Chapter (2.5.2) and (5.4) from my [dissertation](#dissertation).

## Maze Solving

3 Algorithms were implemented to solve the maze, these were picked based on time to solve, shortest path found and ease to implementation. For more infomration see my [dissertation](#dissertation).

* **Depth first search** - The fastest of all algorithms, it shows the shortest path as it is searching and marks wrong turns in red.

* **Breadth first search** - Finds the shortest path through a braided maze, traces the shortest path back once it finds the end, but is slow.

* **Wall follower** - Is the only implemented algorithm that doesn't find the shortest path a maze. Is a simplistic algorithm that humans can follow easily.

## Robot

The finch robot (birdbraintechnologies.com/finch/) was used to solve the virutal maze, a new algorithm was created that the robot could understand.
