## What can it do

Generate a random maze and show the user step by step how it is generated
Solve the maze with 3 differing algorithms, capturing data on time taken, amount of wrong turns, etc.
Video integration to allow the maze to be overlayed ontop of the video.
Solve the maze with an algorithm that can be translated into directions for a human/robot. Input avaliable for robot to solve the maze.


## How to use

```java
VideoCapture video = new VideoCapture(0); // change the integer to 1 if the webcam is plugged in via usb

Number of Rows & Number of Columns: // Enter even numbers 

WaitTime: // Enter the amount of miliseconds for the application to wait between each change

Camera: // To close the application or genearte a new maze deactive the camera
```

## Maze Generation

After researching many different algoirthms for generating a random maze I chose to implement Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm. This algorithm was developed by the mathematician and computer scientist Joseph Kruskal in 1956. The algorithm works by starting off with a set of edges and merging the edges, as long it doesn't create a loop. As shown the in picture below. 

To see further explainations of researching and implementing the algorithm look at Chapter (2.5.2) and (5.4) from my [dissertation](#dissertation).

## Maze Solving

### Depth first search

### Breadth first search
